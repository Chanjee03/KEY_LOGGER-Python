# KEY_LOGGER-Python
This project is a modular Python-based keylogger and monitoring tool built for cybersecurity education. It captures keystrokes, clipboard data, screenshots, and window activity, with optional data exfiltration, stealth, and self-destruct features â€” helping researchers understand, detect, and defend against similar threats.
